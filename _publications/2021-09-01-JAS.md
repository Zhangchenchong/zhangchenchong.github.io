In this work, we have numerically investigated the variation of fractal characteristics of soot particles as soot is coated. We found that the ideal fractal law can fit the morphologies of coated soot only when the radius of gyration of coated soot is identical to that of the soot core. In that case, the fractal dimension of coated soot is close to that of the soot core, which can explain why the unchanged fractal dimension was observed by the previous study as soot was evenly coated. Our results also show that the fractal parameters of coated soot at different size scales can be varied, so the ideal fractal law is difficult to fit the structures of unevenly coated soot universally.
