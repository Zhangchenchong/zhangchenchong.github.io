#details of this work

Geostationary satellite data, with their excellent temporal resolution, have become powerful tools for studying wildfires which have a rapidly evolving nature. However, due to the relatively coarse spatial resolution of sensors aboard geostationary satellites, we need to further investigate wildfire parameters at the sub-pixel scale. Driven by the need for better sub-pixel fire detection and characterization, we presented a noval approach to resolve the effective temperature variation inside each fire pixel using a semi-empirical heat-transfer algorithm in this work. Our results show that FRP obtained through this method exhibits a stronger linear correlation with those retrieved from airborne measurements. Moreover, by analyzing the temperature variation curve obtained using this method, it is possible to further retrieve the fire area under different combustion conditions within each fire pixel.
