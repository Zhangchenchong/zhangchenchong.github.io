Electron tomography (ET) is used in this study to reconstruct the exact 3-dimensional morphologies of fractal-like soot aggregates. Conventional ET techniques suffer from “the missing wedge” problem caused by unreachable tilt angles, leading to noisy reconstructed tomograms. We overcame this problem by implementing a high-resolution object-edge identification method coupled with a novel voxel-filling algorithm to improve the reconstruction quality. Our reconstructed aggregates capture the irregular morpholgoical structures, which are almost impossible to be modeled in existing pure computational simulation exercises. Q-space analysis predicts the fractal dimension of our ET reconstructed aggregates to be in the range between 2.2 and 2.6, which deviates significantly from the universal value of 1.8 obtained using the widely adopted diffusion limited cluster-cluster aggregation (DLCA) model.
