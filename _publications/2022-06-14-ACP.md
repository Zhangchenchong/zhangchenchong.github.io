Black carbon (BC) is one of the dominant absorbing aerosol species in the atmosphere. It has complex fractal-like structures due to the aggregation process during combustion. BC's aerosol-radiation interaction (ARI) remains large uncertainties among multiple studies due to their different morphological assumption. In most climate and chemical transport models (CTM), the Mie theory is commonly used to calculate the optical properties of particle species with spherical morphologies. Here we modify the aerosol optical module in the a regional CTM to better represent the aggregated morphology of BC particles. By coupling with a radiative transfer code, we further evaluated the effects of particles’ morphologies on BC shortwave ARI. A 1-month simulation in eastern China and a 7-day simulation in the fire regions in the northwest US were performed. The fractal BC model generally presents a larger clear-sky ARI compared to the spherical BC model. Assuming BC particles are externally mixed with other aerosols, the relative differences in the time-averaged clear-sky ARI between the fractal model with a fractal dimension (Df) of 1.8 and the spherical model are 12.1%–20.6% and 10.5%–14.9% for typical polluted urban cities in China and fire sites in the northwest US, respectively.
